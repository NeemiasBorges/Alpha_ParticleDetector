## Mobile Low-Cost Spectrometer API

The Mobile Low-Cost Spectrometer API is an accessible solution for measuring radioactivity and the energy of ionizing radiation, such as alpha particles and electrons. This system is based on two existing projects: the RadStar Alpha equipment and the DIY project supported by CERN (https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector/).

### Overview

This compact spectrometer is designed to provide real-time data, enabling its use in fieldwork, educational applications, and scientific studies. With a portable and affordable design, it democratizes access to radiation measurement, making it an essential tool for a wide range of users.
